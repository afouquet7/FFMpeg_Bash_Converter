# FFMpeg_Bash_Converter
This script looks for .mov files and converts them to h264.mp4 files, with ffmpeg. 
Your system must have ffmpeg installed, since this script works with it.
By changing the ffmpeg line, you can convert your files from any format to any format that ffmpeg supports. 
Future commits will add comments explaining what each flag in the commands does.
